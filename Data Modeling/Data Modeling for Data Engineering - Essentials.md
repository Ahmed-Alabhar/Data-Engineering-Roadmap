# Data Modeling for Data Engineering - Essentials

## I. Introduction to Data Modeling

1. **Data Modeling Basics:** 
   - Understanding the fundamentals of data modeling, including entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) and data modeling techniques.

2. **Data Modeling Tools:** 
   - Overview of popular data modeling tools (e.g., ERwin, Lucidchart, DbVisualizer) and their use in designing data models.

3. **Relational Data Modeling:** 
   - Basics of relational data modeling, including tables, columns, keys, and relationships.

4. **Non-Relational Data Modeling:** 
   - Introduction to non-relational data modeling for NoSQL databases, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.

5. **Normalization and Denormalization:** 
   - Understanding normalization techniques (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and denormalization in data modeling.

6. **Data Modeling Best Practices:** 
   - Best practices for designing effective data models, including data integrity, performance, and scalability considerations.

### Summary
