# SQL for Data Engineering - Essentials

## I. Introduction to SQL

1. **SQL Basics:**
   - Syntax, data types, operators, and basic queries.

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
   - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.

3. **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
   - CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements for database and table management.

4. **Querying Single and Multiple Tables:**
   - JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), UNION, subqueries.

5. **Data Filtering and Sorting:**
   - WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING clauses.

6. **Data Aggregation Functions:**
   - SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX for data aggregation.

## II. Intermediate SQL

7. **Advanced Query Techniques:**
   - Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, recursive queries.

8. **Transaction Management:**
   - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT for transaction control.

9. **Indexing and Optimization:**
   - Creating and using indexes for query optimization.

10. **Data Integrity and Constraints:**
    - Ensuring data integrity using constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL).

11. **Views and Stored Procedures:**
    - Creating and using views and stored procedures for data abstraction and reusability.

12. **Normalization and Database Design:**
    - Understanding normalization forms and designing efficient databases.
