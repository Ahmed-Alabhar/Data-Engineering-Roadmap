   - Using resources (CPU, memory) efficiently in scripts.

6. **Avoiding Redundancy:**
   - Avoiding redundant code and optimizing script logic.

7. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Regularly reviewing and optimizing scripts for performance.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Testing scripts thoroughly and validating inputs to prevent errors.
